# Optimally_Deep_Networks

This repository contains the implementation of **Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs)** â€” A novel approach to train deep neural networks with only the **necessary depth** for a given task, reducing model size, FLOPs, and inference cost while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Following Jupyter notebooks are provided publicly:
